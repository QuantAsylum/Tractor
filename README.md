# Tractor
Tractor is a small program to allow custom test profiles to be rapidly created. Tractor then "drives" these profiles and 
controls the QA401 application to make the measurments. In the current check-in, Tractor can make gain, THD, noisefloor 
and IMD (ITU) measurements. 

The product is currently in alpha release. A video of an early version of the product being used is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jem6Rxyk630). 

Release 0.7 of the product re-factors a lot of the test classes, and provides two new tests.
