# Tractor
Tractor is a small program to allow custom test profiles to be rapidly created. Tractor then "drives" these profiles and 
controls the QA401 and QA450 application to make the measurments. In the current check-in, Tractor can make the followin
measurements: 
* Gain, 
* THD
* Noise
* Amplitude
* IMD
* Amp output impedance
* Amp efficiency measurements
