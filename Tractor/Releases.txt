0.93
- Added FreqResponseChirpA01
- Changes so that UI builder can support string file names, a button for loading a file, and checking to verify file exists. 
This is used for loading masks

0.92
- Added ability for any test to provide an operator notification during PASS. The last test to set 
  the operator notification will have that notification shown. This means if you want a message to 
  be passed to the operator, the test that does so should be the last test OR subsequent tests must
  not overwrite the operator notification
- Added GainSorted5A01 and GainSorted3A01 tests
- Perf change on tree view redraw

0.91 
- Minor bug fixing

0.9 
- Massive cleanup and re-structuring

0.75
- Added splash
- Added cloud database support
- QA401 Test flow now resembles QA401H test flow (eg processing done without pulling data across)
- Significant re-structuring of THD and RMS measurements internally. These have only been lightly tested
- Requires QA401 version 1.709 or later, and QA401H version 0.94 or later
- Added complete error checking to Gain01 test. This needs to be replicated out to other other tests
- Made FFT size an option for every test


0.72
- Major re-structuring for implementing test hardware. They are now a collection of interfaces, and you group interfaces
  based on instrument availability and functionality. Options may be supersetted or subsetted.
- Added Audition01 test command
- Provided ability to display a picture to the operator in Input01
- Database logging is now working

- Added checkbox permit stopping a test on failure
- Start button is Accept() behavior, Stop button is default cancel button
- Added ability for the app to load QAAnalyzer.EXE assembly from default install locations
- Clean up to internal code paths. Got rid of dependence on Form.This via some delegates to handle editing.
