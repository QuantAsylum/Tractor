1.1
- Added support for QA40x
- Disabled support for cloud audit database in new projects
- Simplified and clarified error reporting for tests not available. That is, if you try to make a voltage measurement
  but you don't have a volt meter as part of your configuration, the message will be more helpful


1.01
- Default FFT size for FreqResponseA01 to 32K (change min required QA401 version to 1.916 to ensure this is avoided)

1.01
- Fixed issue related to RemotingRunSingleFrExpoChirp. In previous QA401 release the number of args was changed, but that wasn't updated in Tractor
- Default FFT size for FreqResponseA01 to 32K (change min required QA401 version to 1.916 to ensure this is avoided)


1.0
- Operator Dlg Prompt window made always on top
- Added QA351 voltage test

0.999
- Added command line switch to dump help and terminate. The help file (Tractor_Help.md) is markdown and placed int the Tractor data directory . It's used to generate the help that is uploaded
  at github.
- Lots of changes for spelling, unifying field names, etc. 

0.998
- Fixed bug where unselected channels were not being muted. That is, if you create a test and opt to check on left channel only, the right channel should 
  be muted. This allows testing power amps with limited supplies. 
- If both channels are selected for test, then left and right channels will be displayed. Similarly if a channel is muted it won't be displayed. This change touched
  every test module, so be aware of peculiarties.
- Change the behavior where a CSV log exception does NOT stop logging and continue. Instead, the test will fail with a message to check log. You can then go Tools 
  and open the program log
- This version requires QAAnalyzer.EXE version 1.908. 
  

0.997
- Added ability to log to CSV file. CSV files will be logged to a directory located at C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\QuantAsylum\Tractor\CsvLogs
- Consolidated UI on logging
- Verify all database logging options are correct when opening older test files with this version!

0.995
- Removed old-style deprecated interfaces (old style = pass data back and forth via remoting. new style = don't pull data over, just ask for calc to be done on host)
- Fortified logging of exceptions with some more detail

0.994
- Fixed bug where older-style audit records could get stuck and never upload to server
- Fixed bug where stuck records hogged all the upload time and fresh records were ignored
- Fixed bug so that AuditDb warning was only shown when first enabled instead of everytime you entered settings
- Updated cloud server to 0.52
- Updates to Mic Comparison to handle new Axis and FFT

0.993
- Fixed bug where switching tests plans could result in inability to re-establish connection to QA401.
- Moved FFT sizes from bytes to kBytes. In older test-plans (pre 0.993) that are opened, they will be migrated automatically.
- EfficiencyA07 wil now work on single channel or both channels
- Logging will now happen to the file Tractor_log.txt located in <user>\documents\QuantAsylum\Tractor. Mostly this is exceptions
- Paths formed are now linux-safe
- Added ability to set Y axis limits for all audio settings

0.991
- Fixed typo in Impedance test
- Changed button text in Run dialog to "Back to Editor" instead of "Close"
- Fixed typo in efficiency test
- Added FreqResponseA03 test.
- Added ability to set Y axis on all plugins

0.99
- Increase max fft to 64k
- Changes to efficiency measurement to ensure current is accurately captured
- Fixed typo/bug in powerstate (text label was wrong)
- Switched to QA450 REST interface (no more service stack)
- This version requires QA450 v1.21 or later and QA401 v1.78 or later

0.982
- Added option for filename to be empty

0.981
- Add new file picker button to PromptA00 and AuditionA01 tests.
- Minor cleanup to QA401 app launch code

0.98
- UI made more finger friendly with fatter buttons for touch screens
- Added ThdNA01 for measuring THD+N
- Activated lock code so that run screen can be locked down. The intent here is to ensure that accidental button presses won't close the test screen
- Installer will install registry keys and register the file type "*.tractor_tp". This allows you to double click on a test file and launch Tractor
- Check will make sure QA401 version is >= 1.78 when using QA401 hardware


0.93
- Added FreqResponseChirpA01
- Changes so that UI builder can support string file names, a button for loading a file, and checking to verify file exists. 
This is used for loading masks

0.92
- Added ability for any test to provide an operator notification during PASS. The last test to set 
  the operator notification will have that notification shown. This means if you want a message to 
  be passed to the operator, the test that does so should be the last test OR subsequent tests must
  not overwrite the operator notification
- Added GainSorted5A01 and GainSorted3A01 tests
- Perf change on tree view redraw

0.91 
- Minor bug fixing

0.9 
- Massive cleanup and re-structuring

0.75
- Added splash
- Added cloud database support
- QA401 Test flow now resembles QA401H test flow (eg processing done without pulling data across)
- Significant re-structuring of THD and RMS measurements internally. These have only been lightly tested
- Requires QA401 version 1.709 or later, and QA401H version 0.94 or later
- Added complete error checking to Gain01 test. This needs to be replicated out to other other tests
- Made FFT size an option for every test


0.72
- Major re-structuring for implementing test hardware. They are now a collection of interfaces, and you group interfaces
  based on instrument availability and functionality. Options may be supersetted or subsetted.
- Added Audition01 test command
- Provided ability to display a picture to the operator in Input01
- Database logging is now working

0.64
- Add colorcoding for pass fail
- Added final P/F dlg
- Hide main window when running tests
- Displayed limits in datagrid
- More code to ensure power state is disabled upon operator stop/exception or otherwise abnormal termination
- Added checkbox permit stopping a test on failure
- Start button is Accept() behavior, Stop button is default cancel button
- Added ability for the app to load QAAnalyzer.EXE assembly from default install locations
- Clean up to internal code paths. Got rid of dependence on Form.This via some delegates to handle editing. 

0.63
- Fixed copy/paste bug on left/right channel pass/fail decode
- Fixed name of font in datagrid
